# LinearRegression-Project 
<h1> End-to-End Linear Regression Project: Car Price Prediction </h1>
:Project Overview:
This project aims to predict car prices based on user inputs using a Linear Regression model. The features considered include car name, company name, manufacturing year, kilometers driven, and fuel type. This end-to-end implementation incorporates data cleaning, model development, and user interaction through a streamlined interface.

Key Steps
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing :
Raw data was  cleaned to address inconsistencies, missing values, and irrelevant features.
Categorical features were encoded appropriately, and numerical features were scaled to ensure optimal model performance.
The cleaned dataset was then exported for use in the model-building phase.

Model Building:
The cleaned dataset was loaded into a Jupyter Notebook to build and train the predictive model.
A Linear Regression algorithm was used to the relationships between the inputfeatures and car prices.
The model was evaluated for accuracy using metrics like  r2-score, ensuring a reliable prediction mechanism.

User Interface with Streamlit:
A user-friendly interface was designed using Streamlit to allow users to input car details (e.g., name, company, year, kilometers driven, fuel type) and receive predicted prices.
The UI includes  input fields, dropdowns, and a well-formatted display for the prediction results, making it accessible even for non-technical users.
